                  <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                  <p>Born in the lake city of Bhopal. I have been able to connect the dots for many pieces on whichever board i'm playing, weather it's stock investing, coding, or startups. </p>


                   The key to my success till now has been identifying talented individuals and harnessing
                   their efforts. And I aim at improving that skill by taking up more stimulating roles like these</p>


                   I consider myself as someone with extraverted, intuitive, thinking, and charismatic personality traits. Being a stock market investor, I believe that knowledge is power,and try to gather information to construct my creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.
                   </p>
                  <h2>Strengths </h2>
                  <p>1. Efficient - I see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away. I will try my best to create an efficient and learning environment in my team </p>

                  2. Self-confident - I couldn't have achieved the success that I have had in my life if I was plagued by self-doubt. I will help my TMs to trust their abilities and make their opinions.</p>

                  3. Long Term Thinker - I try to exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigation of the challenges and steps of a bigger plan. I try to stay away from momentary solutions to a problem. Successfully breaking down big goals and achieving them is one thing I will definitely help my members in
                  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                  <p>
                  As much as this skill has helped me, being efficient has also created problems for me. My obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism makes me somewhat insensitive in pursuing my goals. I plan on overcoming this weakness by learning to work in a team environment, learning from my members, being a little less cold on everyone else..</p>
